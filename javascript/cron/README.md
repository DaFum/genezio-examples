# Cron example

In this example, we have implemented a very simple class that has a method that will be called every minute.

## Clone the example
1. Run `git clone https://github.com/Genez-io/genezio-examples`
2. Navigate to the folder `cd ./genezio-examples/javascript/cron`

## Run the example locally

Run `genezio local`. This will start a local web server.

## Deploy the example in the Genezio infrastructure

Run `genezio deploy --backend`.
